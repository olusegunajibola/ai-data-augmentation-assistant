# Data Augmentation Assistant for Financial News
---
This repository contains the code and instructions for balancing a dataset of financial news based on sentiment 
using an AI data augmentation assistant. The process involves selecting a specific number of positive and negative 
news items and then augmenting the underrepresented class to achieve a balanced dataset.

## Goal: Build an AI Assistant that augments a dataset.
The goal of this project is to balance a dataset of financial news by augmenting the underrepresented sentiment 
classes. This is achieved using the Groq API for data augmentation. The dataset is initially filtered to include 10 
positive and 6 negative news items, and then the negative class is augmented to match the number of positive items.

## Results
The balanced dataset contains an equal number of positive and negative news items, which can be used for further 
analysis or model training.
